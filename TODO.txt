Automatic Event Manager Reflection 

	support multiple event ids for the handle (right now it fails if you delete an entity with a method handling multiple events)

Injector 
   
	add bind method which works with the class (it doesn't need the field name)

	bind in singleton or in instance

	don't allow null values for dependencies required?

	reuse binded stuff when getInstance(..)

	automatically bind fields of a being binded instance?

Parameters

	add a putAll(Parameters params) method, it requires a way to iterate between Parameters items.

	a way to iterate between Parameters keys (for what??, TODO: add examples the next time)
